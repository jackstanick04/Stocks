Stock Analysis Project

Idea: 
    Store 10 years of 10 companies' stock data in a sql database. Allow the user to execute sql commands from the console with a python connect to view and analyze the data. Users can view one company, compare two companies, or view across all companies for data ranging from the price of a given year, to ranking the standard deviations of company stock prices. Utilizes python OOP, SQL, and validates all input.

Running:
    Main.py creates a Database (python) object and runs the object. The database objects establishes a connect and cursor to the sql database. This database has original code two creates a companies and a shares table for thes tocks, which is then opened and ran at the beginning of each program. The user then uses console based (validated) input to query the data in different ways, in which the data is conveniently printed in tables.

Overall:
    First use of SQL and expanded python knowledge to OOP. Achieved nearly everthing within the project scope. Roughly 20 hour project.

Improve:
    More data analysis methods, more data in original sql to be queried, maybe implement a way to always update the database with the current stock price.
